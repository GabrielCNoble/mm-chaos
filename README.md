# Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask - Chaos Edition

![The chicken have arisen](/media/thumbnail1.png)

This project is based on the excelent Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (US) 1.0 [decompilation project](https://github.com/zeldaret/mm). 

**This repo does not include any assets or assembly code necessary for compiling the ROM. A prior copy of the game is required to extract the required assets.**

## Building
Currently not buildable, sorry :(

Still gotta figure out asset extraction from a modified rom.

## Patching
The bps patches were created against Majora's Mask (U), so you'll need that.

## Special thanks 
Special thanks goes to Aegiker, the Bat Basement community, the Zelda Decompilation server, for the invaluable help, and MrThee, for the Redeadass Groove effect.
